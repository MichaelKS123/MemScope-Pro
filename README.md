# MemScope-Pro
MemScope Pro is a comprehensive memory forensics toolkit written in C++ for analysing system memory dumps to detect hidden processes, injected code, rootkits, and other suspicious activity. It uses advanced pattern recognition and OS internals knowledge to identify anomalies in memory that could indicate system compromise.
